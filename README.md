Install the dependencies by running the command:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
We need multiple devices in the same LAN for testing. For that we need to make our localhost public. For that, download ngrok from https://ngrok.com/download and install it.

To start the development server, run the command:
```bash
  python manage.py runserver
```
For testing on multiple devices in the same LAN, go to the directory where you have installed ngrok. Run the command: ngrok.exe http 8000 This will make our localhost public and provide two public URLs. However, make sure to always use the one that starts with https: and not http: as we will be accessing media devices.

ngrok are running now change your Allow Host in settings.py

On local device, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ On other devices, go to the URL from ngrok that starts with https:.
